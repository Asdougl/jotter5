Electron-based media PC software that just opens the apps in iFrames. Hopefully not requiring you to login...<div>Windows or Linux based (linux to save money), but probably running on x86 not arm.</div><div><br></div><div>Apple TV Like UI that is resortable.</div><div>Designed to be used with mouse &amp; arrow keys, so it supports a remote of some kind, potentially even an XBOX Controller.</div><div>Maybe you could run this on a living room PC and it could give a link to steam too?</div><div><br></div><div>Buttons to support:</div><div>&nbsp;a) UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT</div><div>&nbsp;b) Volume Up/Down</div><div>&nbsp;c) Home</div><div>&nbsp;d) Back</div><div>&nbsp;e) Mute</div><div>&nbsp;f) Select (obvs)</div><div><br></div><div>Min buttons should be:</div><div>&nbsp;Directional, Ok, Back</div><div>with home being super useful:</div><div><br></div><div>Keyboard should only use the arrows &amp; ins, home, end, pg, etc. keys so they keyboard is reserved for searching and shit.</div><div><br></div><div>Customisable Layout, can map any website. Create a repo for website images.</div><div><br></div><div>You can't use iframes because most websites block it. Options are:</div><div>&nbsp;a) &lt;webview&gt; tag, stability is questionable</div><div>&nbsp;b) electron BrowserWindow and render as separate window.</div><div><br></div><div>benefits of separate window means you can more simply separate processes. just need a way of more simply managing multiple windows, i.e. switching back to main window when done with youtube for example.</div><div><br></div><div>Need to ensure login details are retained between loads. Using electron is basically a no-go if it cannot retail your login.</div><div><br></div><div>Alternately you could just run in-browser. Look into the Tabs API, the host tab could generate tabs and track them itself. If in full-screen, nobody would be any the wiser.</div><div><br></div><div>Issues encountered:</div><div>&nbsp;Using separate BrowserWindows seems like a decent solution, however... there is no proper way to integrate some kind of navigation shell into the BrowserWindow.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Spofity doesn't allow the web-player in electron for whatever reason.</div><div><br></div><div>=&gt;&gt; Idea No. 2</div><div>In-browser but its always Fullscreen.</div><div><br></div><div>Build a Vue-based UI which allows for easy navigation.</div><div>The Tabs API allows you to execute scripts on other tabs.</div>
