<div>Replicator swarm attacks earth after the launch of the first five arks. A 6 month month gap between the next ark was enough time for the swarm to overwhelm the population. A last ditch attempt to escape saw the final arc leave but hurredly, leading them to go off course and travel slightly slower through the hypershot.</div><div><br></div><div>trip ~ 100 years,</div><div>come out every 5 years (i.e. 20 times) for a month, during which you attend to others and maintain the ark. In total you'll spend 20 months out of the hibernation. The reason for this is that the insane drugs they pump through you for hibernation will start to take a toll after 5 years and so you need to come out and flush your body. The first week out of hibernation is awful, but by the end you're basically back to normal. The process has a ~1% fatality rate, i.e. of the 10,000 onboard, 100 will die and those bodies must be disposed of during that 1 month out of hibernation. The trip is basically described as 20 months in hell. The lingering effects of the drugs meant that the people who made it would slowly die off over the next 100 years, bar a few who would continue to live full lives (600 years +).</div><div><br></div><div>On the sixth ark, a more refined concoction was used for hibernation, and so the majority of those people were able to live longer and knew of the swarm.</div><div><br></div><div>Travelled 2000ly at 99.87c (102 years)</div><div><br></div><div>left earth in 2140, arrive 4142</div><div>around 600 years later (4742)</div><div><br></div><div>Fun fact the "Galactic Timekeeping System" or GTS is calculated in Years, but few know the origin of the term year.</div><div><br></div><div>Travelled 2181ly at 99.89 years</div><div><br></div><div>Left in 2141.</div><div>Travelling for 2181 years, which was dilated to 102 years.
