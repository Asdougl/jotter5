History of Cythera begins with the God Auros.<div><br></div><div>Auros built the world and created humans.</div><div>When Auros died he passed the mantle of godhood to a human, Arcaenos.</div><div><br></div><div>Arcaenos created magic through the Arcaenian Flame, often called Arcane Magic. He allowed humans to study and learn its powers.</div><div>Arcaenos passed the mantle to Draecon.</div><div><br></div><div>Draecon stole the flame from humanity and created an army of Dracons, later known as Dragons. Those who knew arcane magic had to artificially extend their lives to protect humanity from the dragons. They became known as the enflamed.</div><div>He passed the mantle onto a Dragon, Au'Karos.</div><div><br></div><div>Au'Karos fought a deadly war against the humans and eventually won, sending the enflamed into hiding. After thousands of years the enflamed found the arcaenian flame and became more powerful, eventually defeating Au'Karos. Their leader, Alcorin, became the next God.</div><div><br></div><div>Alcorin decided the flame was too powerful for Humans and so created the Alcorin Books which he spread around the world. The magic they tought was far weaker than arcane magic. Alcorin forced the dragons to live in the Mountains, away from humans.</div><div><br></div><div>... enflamed go mad and rule the earth.</div><div><br></div><div>the god makia stops ends their rule. Makia replaced the Alcorin Books with the Makia Books, simplified versions which contain most useful knowledge, instead of spreading it through many volumes.</div><div><br></div><div>...the god Louin creates the Giants and the dwarves as races to help humans.</div><div><br></div><div>Dragons return, kill Louin and corrupt the Giants. The Great War occurs, another Dragon god.</div><div><br></div><div>Corrupted Giants revolt, as Demons.</div>
